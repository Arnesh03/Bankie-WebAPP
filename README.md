# Bankie-WebAPP

This is a demo web application of how we transfer funds via net banking from one account to another account .

## It contains some features like : 

**Login**: The demo web application provides four demo accounts to log in and access the features. These demo accounts have pre-defined usernames and passwords.
The first account has a username of "js" and a password of "1111". 

The second account has a username of "jd" and a password of "2222". 

The third account has a username of "stw" and a password of "3333". 

The fourth account has a username of "ss" and a password of "4444".

**Logout**: The application has an automatic timer that starts when you log in to one of the demo accounts. If you do not perform any actions within the application before the timer expires, you will be automatically logged out. This is to ensure the security of the account and to prevent unauthorized access.

**Loan**: The demo web application provides a loan feature, which allows users to get a loan from the application. The loan amount will be directly added to the user's bank balance. However, there is a certain limit to the amount that a user can get as a loan.

**Transfer**: One of the main features of this demo web application is the ability to transfer funds from one demo account to another. To do this, the user needs to specify the sender and receiver accounts and the amount to be transferred. The transferred funds will be deducted from the sender's account and added to the receiver's account.

**Delete account**: The user can delete the account they are currently logged into. Once the account is deleted, it will no longer be available to the user and they will not be able to transfer funds to or perform any actions on that account. The user will be automatically logged out immediately after the account is deleted.

**Sorting**: The user can sort the history of their transactions, including deposits and withdrawals, based on the value of the transactions. This makes it easier for the user to keep track of their financial activity and monitor their bank balance.

**Day**: The demo web application also provides information about the day when a deposit or withdrawal transaction was made. This helps the user keep track of their financial activities and manage their funds more effectively.
